# `linconGaussR`: partial R implementation of `LinConGauss`
###  _samples of Gaussians under linear domain constraints_

**Still under development, i.e. not finished**

The original Python implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/alpiges/LinConGauss). The reference of `LinConGauss` is this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09328). It's very likely this repo will only implement the sampling methods in the near future.
